Choices: A: suburban development, B: apartment building, C: bus stop, D: michigan, E: suburbs
Correct Answer Key: 
Generated Output: <s><s> [INST] Given the question 'The townhouse was a hard sell for the realtor, it was right next to a high rise what?' and the following choices: A: suburban development, B: apartment building, C: bus stop, D: michigan, E: suburbs, which one is correct? Answer only with one of the following A, B, C, D or E. [/INST]{tokenizer.eos_token} C: bus stop.

Explanation:
The context of the question suggests that the townhouse was hard to sell because of a specific entity located nearby. The choices provided include a suburban development, an apartment building, a bus stop, Michigan, and the suburbs. Based on the context, none of the first four options fit except for the bus stop, which could make the townhouse less desirable to some buyers if they prefer quieter neighborhoods or dislike the noise and congestion associated with bus stops. Michigan is not a nearby entity that could make a townhouse harder to sell, and the suburbs is a vague term that doesn't necessarily have a bearing on the situation described in the question.</s>

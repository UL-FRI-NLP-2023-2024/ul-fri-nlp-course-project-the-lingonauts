To disable this warning, you can either:
	- Avoid using `tokenizers` before the fork if possible
	- Explicitly set the environment variable TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=(true | false)

The attention mask and the pad token id were not set. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.

<s><s> [INST] Given the question 'The townhouse was a hard sell for the realtor, it was right next to a high rise what?' and the following choices: A: suburban development, B: apartment building, C: bus stop, D: michigan, E: suburbs, which one is correct? Answer only with one of the following A, B, C, D or E. [/INST]{tokenizer.eos_token} C: bus stop. The question mentions "next to a high rise," which is more descriptive of a building such as an apartment building or a high-rise office building, rather than a suburban development, Michigan, or a bus stop. However, the specific mention of "bus stop" makes that the most likely answer.</s>
